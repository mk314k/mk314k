### ðŸ”¬ Highlighted Projects

Here are a couple of projects I'd like to highlight:

#### 1. 3dAttnVAEGAN

This project focuses on the exciting field of 3D shape reconstruction from a single 2D image. Using a unique VAE-GAN model architecture, we tackle the challenge of reconstructing high-quality 3D shapes from limited visual input. The model has been trained on the ShapeNetCore dataset, which contains a vast collection of over 48,600 3D models across 55 common categories. By leveraging the power of deep learning and generative models, we strive to advance the state-of-the-art in 3D shape reconstruction.

#### 2. Inpainting

The Inpainting project showcases my exploration of various algorithms and techniques to regenerate damaged pixels in images. By employing advanced image inpainting algorithms, we can intelligently fill in missing or corrupted regions in images, seamlessly restoring their visual integrity. This project highlights my interest in computer vision and my ability to apply cutting-edge techniques to solve real-world image restoration challenges.
